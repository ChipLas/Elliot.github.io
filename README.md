    <h1>Happy Teacher's Day!</h1>
    <h2>The Teacher Who Motivates Me</h2>
    <p>Hi ma'am Jabelle! Happy Teacher's Day po! There are not enough words in the dictionary for me to describe my thankfulness for you ma'am!</p>
    <p>I wouldn't ask for any different adviser and programming teacher ma'am! Much more than a teacher you have been like a mother to me ma'am.</p>
    <p>You are amazing at your job, even with all the extra responsibilities you have at school, especially with the mess that is Section 1.</p>
    <p>This world needs more people like you ma'am! Much more than a teacher, a kind, loving, understanding, perseverant soul, a mother and a leader.</p>
    <p>I am more than grateful for you ma'am Jabelle!</p>
    <p>Like the sun you shine bright, and like the moon you brighten my dark nights ma'am!</p>
    <p>Happy Teacher's Day ma'am Jabelle, love you po ma'am!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sincerely your student</p>
    <p>Elliot John Pe San Gabriel</p>
